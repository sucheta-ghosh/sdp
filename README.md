# sdp
Shallow-Discourse-Parser (SDP) is a simple, and open source implementation of end-to-end shallow discourse parser based on Penn Discourse TreeBank style discourse annotation and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to generate a shallow discouse structure (connective with sense and two arguments with spans). SDP is designed for generic purpose and can be applied to a variety of NLP tasks.
